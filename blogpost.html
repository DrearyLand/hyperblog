                where we are going to explain the 
                incredibles things that we can do with

                <p>The blogs are the best way to share
                information and ideas. Is a best option than 
                to go to youtube or conferences. Except if 
                you are a Rockstar. But statistically you 
                arenÂ´t... at the moment.</p>
